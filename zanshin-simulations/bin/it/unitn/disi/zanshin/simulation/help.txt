This is Zanshin simulator, a console-based application for running simulations
of adaptive systems managed by the Zanshin framework. As such, you should make
sure the Zanshin framework is executing before running any simulations. 

Available commands:

- exit       Exits the Zanshin simulator.

- help       Shows this help message.

- list       Lists the available simulations (as configured in the 
             simulations.properties file).

- sim [N]    Starts simulation N (according to what is configured in the 
             simulations.properties file). If N is omitted, executes all
             configured simulations in sequence.
